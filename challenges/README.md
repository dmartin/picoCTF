# picoCTF challenges

### *This part is a work in progress*

This directory contains sample challenges and information on how to write new custom challenges.

## Challenge Server

This is a temporary measure as work to convert challenges to a container-based infrastructure
is ongoing. It uses a stripped-down version of the former Vagrant-based shell server.
To load sample challenges into a running instance of the platform, run `load_samples.sh`.
