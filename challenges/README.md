# picoCTF Sample Challenges

One goal of the picoCTF platform is to standardize the creation and deployment of CTF challenges so that they can serve as an educational tool.  This is largely facilitated through the [shell_manager](../picoCTF-shell/shell_manager) utility and the [hacksport](../picoCTF-shell/hacksport) library.

This [directory](./sample-challenges) contains example problems that demonstrate how to use the picoCTF platform functionality. These are the challenges that are loaded by default into the development environment when you run `vagrant up`.

`sample-weightmap.json` provides an example of a weightmap (formerly *bundle*) file specifying challenge unlock order.
